Code challenge for future colleges

## What this challange is

Something for us to discuss at the technical interview

## What this challange isn't

A test. There's no right way, just some help for us to get a feel for each other.

## Instructions

1. Use the Star Wars API [https://swapi.co/](https://swapi.co/)
2. Get unique vehicles from all characters above 170cm in height.
3. Present them in a list, vertically and horizontally centered.
4. If you want, style it up using `src/styles/main.css`.
5. If you want, add a sweet animation and loading state.

### Info

- Use any framework you want or none.
- You don't need to think about browser support, latest version of chrome is fine.
- Don't spend to much time on this, we'll discuss what you did even if you didn't "finish".
- Use something your'e comfortable with, this is not the time to try that new thing.

## Get started

To help you get started right away we've setup a base template. Use it if you will or roll your own.

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

This will start dev server with automatic reloading using parcel-bundler
