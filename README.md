# code-challenge-frontend
Code challenge for future colleges

## What this challange is

Something for us to discuss at the technical interview

## What this challange isn't

A test. There's no right way, just help for us to get a feel for each other.

## Instructions

1. Use the Star Wars API https://swapi.co/
2. Get unique vehicles from all characters above 170cm in height.
3. Present them in a list, vertically and horizontally centered.
4. If you want, add a sweet animation and loading state.

### Info
- Use any framework you want or none.
- You don't need to think about browser support, latest version of chrome is fine.
- Don't spend to much time on this, we'll discuss what you did even if you didn't "finish".

## Get started

To help you get started right away we've setup a base template. Use it or roll you're own.

```shell
npm install # or yarn install if you wish
npm start # start dev server with automatic reload using parcel-bundler
```
